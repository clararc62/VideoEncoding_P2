# VideoEncoding_P2
Here we find the exercises for Practice 2 of Video Encoding Systems.
We can also observe all the outputs that the scripts generate. 
If you want to run this code, you need the Big Buck Bunny video download. 

In ex5.py, it is able to run the all the exercises with a user interaction. It is important to compute first ex1.py, since by this way we will obtain BBB_cut.mp4, 
that is the video used in the other scripts.
